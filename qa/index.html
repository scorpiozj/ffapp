It is fully compliant with the SD Card standards defined by the SD-Association. In addition to that FlashAir™ includes a Wireless LAN chip set plus antenna for wireless communications.</p> <h3 id="what-s-the-default-password-of-flashair-wi-fi"><a href="#what-s-the-default-password-of-flashair-wi-fi" class="header-anchor">#</a> What's the default password of FlashAir Wi-Fi?</h3> <p>The default password is: 12345678.</p> <h3 id="the-flashair™-wireless-lan-access-point-suddenly-disappeared-what-happened"><a href="#the-flashair™-wireless-lan-access-point-suddenly-disappeared-what-happened" class="header-anchor">#</a> The FlashAir™ Wireless LAN access point suddenly disappeared. What happened?</h3> <p>There are most likely 2 reasons for this:</p> <p>The camera in which the FlashAir™ SD Card is inserted turned off automatically or went into Stand-By mode because it was not used for a certain time. In this case the FlashAir™ SD Card does not get power from the camera anymore and the Wireless LAN turns off.
Solution: Check the settings of the camera and extend the time until the camera goes to stand-by or will turn off.</p> <p>FlashAir™ has a time-out function. If there was no Wireless LAN communication for a certain time, FlashAir™ will automatically turn off the Wireless LAN function to save power.
Solution: With the FlashAir™ configuration tool you can set the time until the Wireless LAN is turned off according to your preference.</p> <h3 id="are-there-any-flashair™-compatible-devices-other-than-digital-cameras"><a href="#are-there-any-flashair™-compatible-devices-other-than-digital-cameras" class="header-anchor">#</a> Are there any FlashAir™ compatible devices other than digital cameras?</h3> <p>Any device with an SDHC™ slot can potentially be used.</p> <h3 id="how-far-is-the-wireless-communication-distance"><a href="#how-far-is-the-wireless-communication-distance" class="header-anchor">#</a> How far is the wireless communication distance?</h3> <p>It depends on the neighbouring environment. Wireless communication is possible at a distance of just a few centimetres and up to ten meters.</p> <h3 id="what-is-ap-mode"><a href="#what-is-ap-mode" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is AP mode?</h3> <p>By default, the FlashAir will run in AP (Access Point) mode. In AP mode, when a device (such as a PC or smartphone) connects to the FlashAir as a client it will be unable to access the Internet. In this mode, the device which connects to FlashAir usually could not visit the Internet.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/AP.a903a8e5.png" alt="Access point diagram"></p> <h3 id="what-is-station-mode"><a href="#what-is-station-mode" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is Station mode ?</h3> <p>Station (STA) mode is a mode to use FlashAir as a client in a wireless LAN. It allows for a development machines to access to the FlashAir and the Internent at a same time.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/STA.ac7a435c.png" alt="station mode diagram"></p> <h3 id="what-is-internet-thru-pass-mode"><a href="#what-is-internet-thru-pass-mode" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is Internet-thru pass mode?</h3> <p>Internet pass-thru mode allows you to connect to the Internet with your PC or smartphone while they are connected to the FlashAir card.<br>
When configured in Internet pass-thru mode, the FlashAir will act both as a station (STA mode) and as an access point. The FlashAir will behave like a router, bridging the connection between devices connected to it and a secondary (or &quot;Parent&quot;) network.<br>
If the parent network is connected to the internet, your devices will have access to the FlashAir and the internet simultaniously.<br>
If the connection to the Parent Network fails, the FlashAir will boot in AP mode - and it may take some time before the FlashAir's network is available.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/Thru.fde5bd0d.png" alt="internet pass-thru mode"></p> <h2 id="advanced-solutions"><a href="#advanced-solutions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Advanced Solutions</h2> <h3 id="what-s-the-config-file"><a href="#what-s-the-config-file" class="header-anchor">#</a> What's the CONFIG file?</h3> <p>It includes the FlashAir's configuration, and it is located on the SD card in the folder /SD_WLAN and the filename is CONFIG with no extension (i.e. it is simply CONFIG and not CONFIG.txt for example). It is ordinarily a hidden file so in order to see and edit this on your computer you will need to make sure you have allowed hidden files and folders to be visible for your SD slot.<br>
Notice:</p> <ol><li>Always make a copy before editing the file</li> <li>Always eject the FlashAir from computer and then remove it from the slot</li></ol> <h3 id="how-can-i-change-the-password-for-the-wpa2-secured-wireless-lan-channel"><a href="#how-can-i-change-the-password-for-the-wpa2-secured-wireless-lan-channel" class="header-anchor">#</a> How can I change the password for the WPA2 secured Wireless LAN channel?</h3> <p>There are 3 options:</p> <p>When you unpack the FlashAir™ SD Card the very first time, you may use it in the SD Card slot of your PC. On the Downloads tab you will find a small installation file which you can start and install the configuration tool for FlashAir™. After launching the configuration tool, you will find the option in the Menu “Card Setting”. Here you can change the password and if you like also change the SSID name. This password needs to have at least 8 characters.  If you delete the default password and do not enter a new password, the Wireless LAN channel of the FlashAir™ SD Card will not be secured anymore and anyone could connect to its Access Point.
When you unpack the FlashAir™ SD Card the very first time you can immediately insert it into your camera and start taking pictures. Connect a remote host via Wireless WLAN with the FlashAir™ access point. Enter the default password of “12345678” and access the card with a browser using the address http://flashair/. You can change the password and the SSID if needed using the menus. The password needs to have at least 8 characters. If you delete the default password and do not enter a new password, the WLAN channel of the FlashAir™ SD Card will not be secured anymore and anyone could connect to its Access Point.
You can use the iOS or Android App to configure the FlashAir SD Card by selecting the appropriate menu in the app.</p> <h2 id="pratical-useage"><a href="#pratical-useage" class="header-anchor">#</a> Pratical Useage</h2> <h3 id="how-to-set-up-wireless-printing-with-toshiba-flashair-sd-cards"><a href="#how-to-set-up-wireless-printing-with-toshiba-flashair-sd-cards" class="header-anchor">#</a> How to set up wireless printing with Toshiba FlashAir SD cards</h3> <p><a href="https://blog.prusaprinters.org/easy-wireless-printing-with-flashair-sd-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <h3 id="hooking-into-your-printer-without-wires"><a href="#hooking-into-your-printer-without-wires" class="header-anchor">#</a> Hooking into your printer without wires</h3> <p><a href="http://microfabricator.com/blogs/view/id/54e438e56983c5316480205e/using-a-flashair-wifi-enabled-sdcard-with-your-3d-printer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <h2 id="useful-links"><a href="#useful-links" class="header-anchor">#</a> Useful Links</h2> <h3 id="official-docs"><a href="#official-docs" class="header-anchor">#</a> Official Docs</h3> <p><a href="https://www.toshiba-memory.com/faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Official Support FAQs<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
